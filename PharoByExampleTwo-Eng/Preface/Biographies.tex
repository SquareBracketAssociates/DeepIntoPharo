St\'ephane Ducasse is directeur de recherche at Inria. Since 2011, he is scientific deputee of the Inria Lille Nord Europe 
research center where he leads the RMoD (http://rmod.lille.inria.fr) team. He is expert in two domains: object-oriented language design and reengineering.  He worked on traits, composable groups of methods, and this work got some impact. Traits have been introduced in AmbiantTalk, Racket, Squeak/Pharo, Perl, PHP and  under a variant into Scala, Fortress of SUN Microsystems. He is one of the developer of Pharo (http://www.pharo.project.org) a new dynamic language used in industry and academia. He is also expert on software quality, program understanding, program visualizations, reengineering and metamodeling. He is one of the developer of Moose, an open-source software analysis platform (http://www.moosetechnology.org).  He is working with Synectique (http://www.synectique.eu) a company building dedicated tools for advanced software analysis.
