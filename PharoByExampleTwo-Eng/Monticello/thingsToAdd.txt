A Monticello version is the snapshot of one or more packages. A version contains the complete set of class and method definitions that constitute the underlying packages. Sometimes, it is useful to have a ``patch'' from two versions. A patch is the set of all necessary changes to go from one version A to another version B. 

\emph{Change set} is mechanism to define system patches. A change set is composed of global side effects on the system. New change set may be created and edited from the \emph{Change Sorter}. This tool is available from the \emph{Tool} entry of the \emph{World menu}.

The difference between two Monticello versions may be easily captured by creating a new change set before loading a second version of a package. As an illustration, we will capture the differences between version 1 and 2 of the \ct{Perfect} package:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Load version 1 of \ct{Perfect}
\item Open a change sorter and create a new change set. Let's call it \ct{DiffPerfect}
\item Load version 2
\item In the change sorted, you should now see the difference between version 1 and 2. The change set may be saved on the filesystem by right clicking on it and selecting \ct{file out}. A \ct{DiffPerfect.X.cs} file is now located next to your \Pharo image.
\end{enumerate}
